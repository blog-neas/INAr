First of all, thanks for considering contributing to `INAr`! üëç 
`INAr` is an open source project maintained by people who care, and an help is always appreciated. üòä

 [repo]: https://github.com/blog-neas/INAr
 [issues]: https://github.com/blog-neas/INAr/issues
 [new_issue]: https://github.com/blog-neas/INAr/issues/new
 [website]: https://blog-neas.github.io/en/

 [email]: mailto:lucio.palazzo@unina.it

There are several ways you can contribute to this project. 

 - Think `INAr` is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.

 - Using `INAr` for a paper you are writing? Consider [citing it][citation].

### Ask a question ‚ÅâÔ∏è

Using `INAr` and got stuck? Browse the [documentation][website] to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.

Want to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [email][email].

### Propose an idea üí°

Have an idea for a new `INAr` feature? Take a look at the [documentation][website] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.

See below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well. See also the Roadmap section above.

### Report a bug üêõ

Using `INAr` and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:

* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Care to fix bugs or implement new functionality for `INAr`? Awesome! üëè Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on.

### Improve the documentation üìñ

Noticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome! Functions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you want to improve a function description:

1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository][repo].
2. Look for the file with the name of the function.
3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).
